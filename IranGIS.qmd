title: "Iran GIS Project"
---

During my time studying abroad in Sweden, I completed a final project using ArcGIS to estimate the cost of maintaining road networks in Iran based on a variety of factors. This poster displays the conclusions that my group and I came to, and we won first place out of all the groups for our presentation of this project.
