### Hello!

Thanks for visiting my website. My name's Rylee and I'm a senior Environmental Studies student at UC Santa Barbara. I'll be graduating in Spring 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Studies, with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems. After graduation, I'll be working as a GIS Intern on the Grid-Scale Renewables Team at ENGIE North America. Outside of work, I love snowboarding, bird watching, hiking, paddle boarding, and dancing.
