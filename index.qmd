Hello!

Thanks for visiting my personal website. My name is Rylee Pupa and I'm a senior Environmental Studies student at UC Santa Barbara. I'll be graduating in Spring 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Studies, with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems. After graduation I'll be working as a GIS Intern on the Grid-Scale Renewables Team at ENGIE North America.
