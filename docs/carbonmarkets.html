<p><strong>In-depth Q&amp;A: “What role do carbon markets play in reaching global net-zero targets”</strong></p>
<p>Carbon markets are becoming an increasingly popular strategy for countries and corporations to offset their carbon emissions. Voluntary and mandatory carbon markets have grown faster in recent years than ever before and currently manage around a quarter of all carbon emitted globally. As more countries apply carbon pricing instruments and carbon offset schemes to their net zero goals, carbon markets will play an increasingly important role in meeting short term emissions-reductions goals while we look for solutions to decarbonize the global economy. Despite their growing implementation, climatologists often disagree on the effectiveness of carbon markets. Proponents argue that market forces can help effectively curb emissions, while critics assume that offset schemes will displace emissions without truly eliminating them. In this In-Depth Q&amp;A, we investigate the effectiveness of carbon market policies and implementation in reaching global net-zero goals.</p>

<li><p>What is the scale of mandatory carbon markets globally?</p></li>
<li><p>Who manages and holds people accountable in carbon markets?&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p>What are the socioeconomic implications of carbon markets, especially relating to emissions and equity issues between the Global North and Global South?</p></li>
<li><p>What are some other limitations to carbon markets?</p></li>
<li><p>Are carbon markets an effective climate change mitigation strategy?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are carbon markets and how are they defined by the Paris agreement?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Carbon markets are a climate policy tool in which carbon credits are bought and sold. Typically, carbon credits are defined in terms of the tonnes of CO2 or CO2eq <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-are-carbon-markets-and-why-are-they-important">“reduced, sequestered or avoided”</a>. Carbon markets are either voluntary or mandatory, which can be distinguished by the type of emissions reductions schemes put in place and who regulates them.</p>
<p>Mandatory markets work through setting a regulated price on carbon emissions. <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/a1abead2-de91-5992-bb7a-73d8aaaf767f">Carbon taxes</a> are one policy instrument used by governments to limit emissions by placing a fee on GHG emissions, therefore providing a financial incentive to lower emissions. Another strategy governments can utilize are Emissions Trading schemes, which are more commonly known as cap and trade schemes. Emitting industries have pollution allowances that they must legally comply with, and if they are over the limit they can offset their emissions through <a href="https://nationalaglawcenter.org/considering-carbon-overview-of-carbon-market-composition/">cap and trade</a>.&nbsp; If they have an unused emissions allowance, they can sell it to other companies and profit (trade). Mandatory carbon markets are regulated through both international and domestic carbon reduction schemes. Unlike voluntary markets, mandatory markets can be used to achieve obligations under the <a href="https://climatetrade.com/voluntary-market-and-mandatory-carbon-credit-market/">Kyoto Protocol</a>. State mandated carbon offsets are termed <a href="https://climatetrade.com/voluntary-market-and-mandatory-carbon-credit-market/">Certified Emission Reductions (CERs)</a>, which are issued after the reduction measure has been implemented.</p>
<p>Most carbon markets in the U.S. are voluntary. Individuals or private companies can choose to purchase carbon offsets to reduce their emissions, and their money goes towards mitigation projects. Voluntary carbon markets use <a href="https://climatetrade.com/voluntary-market-and-mandatory-carbon-credit-market/">Verified Emission Reduction (VER)</a>credits to help reach ‘net-zero’ goals, which are verified by an independent third party who specialize in carbon offset programs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the scale of mandatory and voluntary carbon markets globally?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The global carbon market has skyrocketed in recent years, with carbon pricing instruments (CPIs) generating <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/24/global-carbon-pricing-generates-record-84-billion-in-revenue">84 billion dollars</a> of revenue globally in 2021. 32 Emissions Trading Systems (ETSs) and 36 carbon taxes make up the totality of mandatory carbon markets around the world, with more being established in the next few years. The distribution of these carbon pricing instruments can be seen in the figure below. Despite being one of the largest emitters, China has the world’s largest carbon market, accounting for 4.5 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per year with very high rates of compliance. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is the second largest market in the world, but with the highest grossing trading revenue. Even as carbon prices continue to grow globally ($/tCO2eq) across many of the major carbon pricing instruments, current prices are not high enough to drive the transformation decarbonization needed to meet 1.5°C warming goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voluntary markets have also grown in size over recent years, largely due to private corporations including carbon offsets in their corporate social responsibility goals. Third party verification organizations issued <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/24/global-carbon-pricing-generates-record-84-billion-in-revenue">88%</a> more credits in 2021 than they did in 2020, around 362 million credits. However, the price of carbon credits in the voluntary market is drastically lower than the price of carbon credits in mandatory markets, with the average cost being $3.82/tCO2eq.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report by the High Level Commission on Carbon Pricing, carbon prices would need to be within the USD 50-100/tCO2e range in order to reach the 2°C essential decarbonization goal agreed on in the Paris agreement through carbon pricing. Currently, only 4% of carbon emissions are covered by a carbon price within this range. We wondered how much money would be generated if even just the United States implemented a nationwide carbon tax of this caliber. Based on the US GDP from 2021 and the sectors for which a carbon tax applies (energy, industry, transportation), the total revenue generated from implementing this carbon tax price range between $241,212,600,000 and $482,425,200,000 (See Supplementary Materials). To put this into perspective, that is 1-2% of the total current United States GDP.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Who manages and holds people accountable in carbon markets?</strong></p>
<p>Although it is known that the processes subsidized by carbon markets (such as afforestation, DAC, and investments in renewable energy) have potential to remove or avoid carbon emissions, carbon offsets are only effective if we can ensure that a promise of decarbonization is being fulfilled.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of carbon market schemes are governed by state or country specific frameworks and are often mandatory to comply with, such as carbon taxes and cap-and-trade programs. However, the majority of accountability in carbon market monitoring comes from international agreements and regulations. As stated previously, country specific CERs are counted towards international agreements on emissions reductions. The primary mechanism for international carbon market monitoring is the <a href="https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol">Kyoto protocol</a>, which has a rigorous monitoring, verification, and compliance system. Emissions are recorded in a public registry managed by the UN Climate Change Secretariat in “Kyoto units” measured in tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The registry tracks the holdings (like a carbon credit bank) and transferring (through emissions trading schemes) of Kyoto units to ensure that credits are not double counted. Since this registry is able to transfer credits from one country to another, effectively forming an International Transaction Log (ITL), the Kyoto registry is considered the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/registry-systems">“backbone infrastructure for the carbon market”</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
Other international agreements under the UNFCCC help monitor specific types of carbon credits. <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism">Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)</a> is a carbon offset program defined by the Kyoto Protocol in which countries can offset their emissions by investing in an emission reduction project in a developing country. <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/land-use--land-use-change-and-forestry-lulucf">Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)</a> is the emission reduction sector that covers removals within the Agriculture, Forestry and, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. Additionally, <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/redd/what-is-redd#:~:text=REDD%2B%20is%20a%20framework%20created,carbon%20stocks%20in%20developing%20countries">REDD+</a> is a framework that outlines emissions reduction activities specifically within the forestry sector. In recent news, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cropped-gabons-carbon-credits-living-planet-report-agriculture-investigations/">Gabon</a> received verification for 90m worth of carbon credits under the UN REDD+ program that can now be sold to other countries. The credits were <a href="https://unfccc.int/documents/616504">assessed and verified</a> by the UNFCCC Secretariat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrarily, voluntary carbon markets are more prone to lack accountability and monitoring. This is mainly due to verification of carbon offsets coming from third parties organizations and companies rather than international governing bodies. Individual corporations may struggle to solely manage and operate their own carbon offsets, due to issues with scale and location, so offset schemes are often managed by outside consulting groups. Both buyers and sellers in the market <a href="https://nationalaglawcenter.org/considering-carbon-overview-of-carbon-market-composition/">participate voluntarily</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many organizations try to regulate and standardize voluntary carbon markets, however there is not an overarching framework or governing body to accomplish this. This lack of framework can lead to blurry lines in authority. For example, the <a href="https://icvcm.org/about-the-integrity-council/">Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market</a> and <a href="https://vcmintegrity.org/about/#block-5">Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative</a> are completely separate entities that both exist to evaluate corporate carbon credits. Countless organizations like these exist, making it difficult to verify the validity of each of their carbon market assessments. Since voluntary markets are operated by several different companies, <a href="https://nationalaglawcenter.org/considering-carbon-overview-of-carbon-market-composition/">“verification standards, credit registries, participation requirements, and project criteria for their carbon market”</a> all vary widely. Without a central management system of the international voluntary carbon market, the concerns of double-counting emissions reductions and credits that are not credible still remain.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What does COP27 mean for voluntary carbon markets?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>COP 27 put voluntary carbon markets at risk by making new progress on carbon credit trading. <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/cop27-may-have-killed-voluntary-carbon-market-better-model-must-take-its-place">Revisions to Article 6</a> of the Paris climate agreement during COP27 provided a special type of carbon credit that can be traded between governments to reduce their emissions. This type of credit differs from voluntary credits because they can’t be double counted and thus are more credible. Voluntary credits can also create more “reputational risk” for companies because of negative perceptions around corporate social responsibility such as greenwashing. The credibility of these Article 6 credits may incentivize companies to invest in them over voluntary credits because they count towards national emissions reduction for the Paris Agreement and can be trusted by government organizations. Also, these Article 6 carbon credits may count as <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/cop27-may-have-killed-voluntary-carbon-market-better-model-must-take-its-place">tax credits</a> in the future which also incentivizes companies to use them in place of voluntary credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another new kind of carbon credit was issued under Article 6.4, termed <a href="https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2022/12/07/was-cop27-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-corporate-offsetting/">“mitigation contributions”</a>, which allow companies to contribute to mitigation efforts without actually claiming them as carbon offsets. This allows companies to maintain a respectable image by showing that they support climate change mitigation efforts without issuing any misleading claims about whether or not their services are carbon neutral. With mitigation contribution credits, companies can help the environment while avoiding any<a href="https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2022/12/07/was-cop27-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-corporate-offsetting/">litigation risks</a> that could result from making misleading claims regarding emissions.</p>
<p>Due to conflict over some of the Article 6 provisions, many of the decisions regarding carbon credits were left until the next COP conference. However, final rules to be outlined in the following conferences may <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/cop27-may-have-killed-voluntary-carbon-market-better-model-must-take-its-place">“exclude emissions avoidance credits, which represent more than 90% of the voluntary market, and nature-based carbon removals, which many view as impermanent.”</a>. This possibility, along with the addition of other types of carbon credits to Article 6 during COP27, may incentivize companies to stop investing in voluntary markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The COP27 talks in Egypt also didn’t outline a way to ensure <a href="https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2022/12/07/was-cop27-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-corporate-offsetting/">transparency and oversight</a>of global carbon markets. The reason for this is that the rules agreed upon will allow countries to designate any information as confidential without a justification. These <a href="https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2022/12/07/was-cop27-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-corporate-offsetting/">confidentiality issues</a> will create issues with accountability in both voluntary and mandatory carbon markets.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are the socioeconomic implications of carbon markets, especially relating to developing countries and different income levels?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Carbon markets can have complex socioeconomic implications, and whether or not these implications are beneficial or harmful is dependent on effective land use planning, economic policies, and accountability standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a universal carbon price within carbon markets could be economically beneficial to developing countries because their dollar value is much lower, so they benefit more from the higher carbon pricing in richer countries. Due to their<a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/gdsmdpg2420084_en.pdf">labor, land, and other living costs being lower</a>, they can profit immensely from universal standard carbon pricing, which allows for extensive innovation and low carbon development. However, carbon pricing and the profits that may ensue will need to be used in tandem with government action, regulatory standards, and technological development in order to effectively benefit developing countries. Expansion of<a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/gdsmdpg2420084_en.pdf">research and development sectors</a> will be necessary because it can take decades for low carbon technologies to be successful in a developing marketplace regardless of if the funds are available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current forms of carbon pricing include carbon taxes and cap and trade programs. <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/gdsmdpg2420084_en.pdf">Cap and trade systems</a> reduce emissions in a predictable manner, but can make energy prices unstable. However, a carbon tax instead makes prices stable but <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/gdsmdpg2420084_en.pdf">reduces certainty</a> with emissions reductions. A universal carbon price, carbon taxes, and cap and trade programs can increase energy prices as carbon markets expand. Making carbon more expensive can result in an increase in energy costs and household costs such as <a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/carbon-pricing-104-economic-effects-across-income-groups/">heating fuel, natural gas, food and electricity</a>. The increases in energy prices and goods can disproportionately fall on the poor if effective economic policies are not in place.</p>
<p>Economic impacts of carbon pricing can be mitigated through effective policy making to ensure that low income groups are not disproportionately affected and actually benefit from the carbon pricing. There will be high revenues from carbon pricing, and governments can direct these revenues towards helping households in the form of <a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/carbon-pricing-104-economic-effects-across-income-groups/">monetary climate credits</a>.&nbsp; Climate credits would be helpful to offset increasing energy and goods prices for low income households. In addition, if profit from these climate credits are taxed, lower income groups will also benefit due to lower marginal tax rates than higher income groups. The economic burden of carbon credits can also be shifted away from low income households through government programs such as social security, tax credits, and <a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/carbon-pricing-104-economic-effects-across-income-groups/">workers compensation</a>. As seen in the figure below, under a $45 per ton CO2 carbon taxing policy, average household welfare benefits for all groups except the highest income earners were increased. Since these programs adjust in proportion with inflation and costs of living, lower income households will benefit from increased government spending.</p>
<p>Shows av<a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/carbon-pricing-104-economic-effects-across-income-groups/">erage household economic welfare changes</a> in the first year of illustrative carbon tax policy with a price of $45 per ton of CO2. Resources for the Future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carbon markets can be incredibly beneficial to developing countries due to high revenues, but if the carbon offset programs are not implemented with consideration of land use impacts, they can harm citizens and local ecosystems. Africa has very low GHG emissions, yet suffers the most from <a href="https://www.undp.org/africa/blog/carbon-justice-all-how-carbon-markets-can-advance-equitable-climate-action-globally">climate change impacts</a>. Many African governments are planning for extensive low carbon development funded by carbon credits earned from their forests and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
<p>During the COP27 conference, the African Carbon Markets Initiative was launched which will expand Africa’s involvement in the global voluntary carbon market. This initiative aims to produce<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop27-key-outcomes-for-food-forests-land-and-nature-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-egypt/">300 million carbon credits and generate 6 billion in revenue</a> by 2030. If accomplished this would be highly productive for their economy, but carbon mitigation strategies will need to be efficiently monitored to ensure there are no negative impacts on local communities.</p>
<p>In addition, Ghana intends to reduce GHG emissions by <a href="https://www.undp.org/africa/blog/carbon-justice-all-how-carbon-markets-can-advance-equitable-climate-action-globally">64MT CO2eq by 2030</a> through a climate smart agriculture project, which will be funded through a voluntary carbon agreement with Switzerland. The project will train farmers in <a href="https://www.undp.org/africa/blog/carbon-justice-all-how-carbon-markets-can-advance-equitable-climate-action-globally">sustainable rice production practices</a> which will significantly decrease methane emissions and improve water efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cropped-gabons-carbon-credits-living-planet-report-agriculture-investigations/">90 million REDD+ credits</a> that were recently verified in Gabon serve as another example of the ways in which carbon credits can help developing countries. The profit from these credits (estimated to be $25-35 per credit) will increase the nation’s wealth and help fund initiatives s<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cropped-gabons-carbon-credits-living-planet-report-agriculture-investigations/">uch as the biodiversity fund (10% of revenue), community empowerment (15%), and climate resilient infrastructure (25</a>%) .&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Voluntary carbon market measures run the risk of harming communities when not managed with respect to local ecosystems and human livelihood. This is especially true in the case of nature-based projects such as carbon credits through reforestation, which can cause immense land use changes that unsettle the communities occupying the reforestation space. Other types of carbon removal strategies which include ocean reservoirs and engineered solutions are often dodgy and can <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop27-key-outcomes-for-food-forests-land-and-nature-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-egypt/">“lack safeguards on human rights and put Indigenous peoples, food systems and biodiversity at risk”</a> . These types of removal strategies were up for consideration during COP27, but the decision for some of them were delayed due to <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop27-key-outcomes-for-food-forests-land-and-nature-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-egypt/">backlash from NGOs</a> on the social and ecological impacts. There is a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.686516/full">long history</a>of the impacts of voluntary carbon market projects when local environmental impacts and local communities are not considered in the planning process. Appropriate planning will be necessary to ensure this history is not repeated.</p>
<p>Alongside encouraging equitable economic policies and fair carbon pricing, key challenges to the expansion of carbon markets, especially voluntary ones, are ensuring that emissions mitigation projects do not harm local communities.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are some other limitations to carbon markets?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since mandatory carbon markets are not scaling up efficiently enough to sequester sufficient emissions, many companies instead have been using voluntary carbon markets to offset <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.686516/full">GHG emissions</a>. With corporations gunning to become more sustainable through net zero pledges, the voluntary carbon market has grown to nearly <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/cop27-may-have-killed-voluntary-carbon-market-better-model-must-take-its-place">$2 billion</a>. Voluntary carbon markets can generate immense profits and have a high potential for emissions impact through mitigation projects and other measures, but are under regulated and thus run the risk of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.686516/full">fraudulent carbon accounting activity</a>. The lack of regulatory standards in voluntary carbon markets can cause them to be favored by corporations who want to reduce their emissions through carbon pledges but not have to deal with intense oversight from the government. In addition, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.686516/full">compliance costs</a> in legislated carbon markets can be high, so industries and businesses may be less inclined to take action to lower their emissions when it is not profitable.</p>
<p>Some of the other issues with voluntary carbon markets are greenwashing, unmeetable climate promises, double emissions counting, and lack of long term oversight. For example, certain promises that companies have made to offset emissions can simply not be met– many companies plan to plant <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.686516/full">vast amounts of trees</a> but this is not sustainable for every emitter. Double accounting occurs when more than one organization claims an offset, creating faulty emissions reductions claims. Voluntary carbon markets must have protocols in place to ensure that carbon market mitigation strategies are not eventually reversed, which would undue any climate change benefits. These types of regulations often require government intervention over the long term.

<li><strong>Are carbon markets an effective climate change mitigation strategy?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of incorporating carbon markets in our global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was best described by Frank Ackerman: <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/gdsmdpg2420084_en.pdf">“appropriate carbon prices and functioning carbon markets are necessary but not sufficient.”</a> Both mandatory and voluntary carbon markets have an important role to play in helping to mitigate climate change, but their effectiveness can not be harnessed without carefully planned economic policy, appropriate carbon pricing, land use planning, and widespread social cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mandatory carbon markets have already made a huge impact by legally requiring emissions cuts. Carbon taxes provide monetary incentives for corporations to cut emissions, and revenues can be reinvested into programs to help citizens and the environment. Voluntary carbon markets have proved to be more difficult to regulate, but with appropriate carbon pricing and oversight they have the potential to both cut emissions and provide revenue to developing countries for low carbon development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world becoming increasingly aware of the mass societal transformation necessary to stop climate change, the highest emitting industries are being forced (rightfully so) to cut their emissions and find ways to decrease their environmental impact in order to stay functional. The social and legal pressure from the climate crisis has made this transformation possible, and carbon markets serve as one of the most important tools that industries have to adhere to sustainable standards while working towards building low carbon production systems. In the long run, well functioning carbon markets with effective carbon pricing as well as a widespread transition to production processes fueled by low carbon energy sources will help us to meet emissions targets. Though there is still a long way to go, carbon markets will play a key role in reducing emissions from all sectors of the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
